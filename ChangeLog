      Thanks to Martin Lorensen <martin /at- lorensen.dk>
    * Removed requirement for SNMP in the Makefile.PL and moved it to t/prereq.t

      4.2.0 version of SNMP on CPAN.  Will now fail in the test phase. 
      Thanks again to Martin Lorensen <martin /at- lorensen.dk>
    * Moved tests from test.pl to t/*
