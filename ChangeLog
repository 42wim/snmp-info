SNMP::Info - Perl5 OO Interface to Network Devices and SNMP MIBs
ChangeLog $Id$

version 0.4 (04/29/03)
    * BIG CHANGE ! Internal Data structure has changed.  
    * Added clear_cache() method
    * Added NO_SUCH support for snmpget (TABLE) calls to get SNMP MIB II data 
      from SNMP Version 1 devices.
    * Methods load_all() and all() have changed their return value. Sorry but the API had to change.
    * New object methods snmp_comm(), snmp_ver(), store(), class(), nosuch() to make it more OO happy.
    * Globals are now cached
    * Added new argument 'AutoSpecify' to new() to auto-connect with subclass 
      detected in device_type()
    * New method specify() returns a new subclass object
    * Subclasses are automatically loaded when specify or autospecify is used!
    * Added methods for Interface statistics (ifInOctets ...)
    * Added methods for Memory and CPU statistics 
    * Added SNMP::Info::Entity, moved out of L2-HP
    * Added SNMP::Info::Layer2::Aironet

version 0.3 (03/06/03)
    * Fixed HP model() warning
    * Added error checking for responses of NOSUCHOBJECT and NOSUCHINSTANCE in _global
      and _load_attr
    * Added more debugging
    * Added info and munging for c_capabilities in SNMP::Info::CD
      Thanks to Martin Lorensen <martin@lorensen.dk>
    * Removed requirement for SNMP in the Makefile.PL and moved it to t/prereq.t
      so that the Module will install via CPAN without trying to install the old
      4.2.0 version of SNMP on CPAN.  Will now fail in the test phase. 
      Thanks again to Martin Lorensen <martin@lorensen.dk>
    * Moved tests from test.pl to t/*
