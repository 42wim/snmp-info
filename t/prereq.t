Net-SNMP not found.  Net-SNMP installs the perl modules
SNMP and SNMP::Session.  As of version 4.2.1 and greater the Perl
modules are no longer distributed on CPAN, as they are specific to different
versions of SNMP. 

Install Net-SNMP from http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net and make sure you run
configure with the --with-perl-modules switch!

Note to Redhat Users:  Redhat, in its infinite wisdom, does not install the 
Perl modules as part of their 8.0 RPMS.  Please uninstall them and install the
newest version by hand.

SNMP module version 4.2.0 found.  Please triple check that you have
version 4.2.0 of Net-SNMP installed, and that you did not accidently install
the SNMP module found on CPAN.  All newer versions are bundled with 
Net-SNMP, and are not available on CPAN.  Please find them at 
http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net .  Make sure you run configure with the 
--with-perl-modules switch.
