=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.

    my $netscreen = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        ) 

    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

    my $class = $netscreen->class();
    print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides abstraction to the configuration information obtainable from a 
Netscreen device through SNMP. See inherited classes' documentation for 
inherited methods.
