SNMP::Info::CiscoPower - SNMP Interface to data stored in
F<CISCO-POWER-ETHERNET-EXT-MIB>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you. 
 my $poe = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        ) 
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class      = $poe->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Info::PowerEthernet class needs a per-device helper function to
properly map the C<pethPsePortTable> to C<ifIndex> values.  This class
provides that helper, using F<CISCO-POWER-ETHERNET-EXT-MIB>.
It does not define any helpers for the extra values that this MIB
contains.

Create or use a device subclass that inherit this class.  Do not use directly.

For debugging purposes you can call this class directly as you would
SNMP::Info

 my $poe = new SNMP::Info::CiscoPower (...);

=head2 Inherited Classes

none.

Note that it requires that the device inherits from Info::Entity.

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<CISCO-POWER-ETHERNET-EXT-MIB>

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

none.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=head2 Power Port Table

=over

=item $poe->peth_port_ifindex()

Maps the C<pethPsePortTable> to C<ifIndex> by way of the F<ENTITY-MIB>.
