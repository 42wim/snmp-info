=head1 DESCRIPTION

SNMP::Info::CDP is a subclass of SNMP::Info that provides an object oriented 
interface to CDP information through SNMP.

CDP is a Layer 2 protocol that supplies topology information of devices that
also speak CDP, mostly switches and routers.  CDP is implemented in Cisco and
some HP devices.

Create or use a device subclass that inherits this class.  Do not use
directly.

Each device implements a subset of the global and cache entries. 
Check the return value to see if that data is held by the device.

=head2 Inherited Classes

None.

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<CISCO-CDP-MIB>

=back

MIBs can be found at ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/v2.tar.gz

=head1 GLOBAL METHODS

These are methods that return scalar values from SNMP

=over

=item  $cdp->hasCDP()

Is CDP is active in this device?  

Accounts for SNMP version 1 devices which may have CDP but not cdp_run()

=item $cdp->cdp_run()

Is CDP enabled on this device?  Note that a lot of Cisco devices that
implement CDP don't implement this value. @#%$!

(C<cdpGlobalRun>)

=item $cdp->cdp_interval()

Interval in seconds at which CDP messages are generated.

(C<cdpGlobalMessageInterval>)

=item $cdp->cdp_holdtime()

Time in seconds that CDP messages are kept. 

(C<cdpGlobalHoldTime>)

=item  $cdp->cdp_id() 

Returns CDP device ID.  

This is the device id broadcast via CDP to other devices, and is what is
retrieved from remote devices with $cdp->id().

(C<cdpGlobalDeviceId>)

=back

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=head2 CDP CACHE ENTRIES

=over

=item $cdp->c_capabilities()

Returns Device Functional Capabilities.  Results are munged into an ascii
binary string, 7 digits long, MSB.  Each digit represents a bit from the
table below.

From L<http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/trsrb/frames.htm#18843>:

(Bit) - Description

=over

=item (0x40) - Provides level 1 functionality.

=item (0x20) - The bridge or switch does not forward IGMP Report packets on
non router ports.

=item (0x10) - Sends and receives packets for at least one network layer
protocol. If the device is routing the protocol, this bit should not be set.

=item (0x08) - Performs level 2 switching. The difference between this bit
and bit 0x02 is that a switch does not run the Spanning-Tree Protocol. This
device is assumed to be deployed in a physical loop-free topology.

=item (0x04) - Performs level 2 source-route bridging. A source-route bridge
would set both this bit and bit 0x02.

=item (0x02) - Performs level 2 transparent bridging.

=item (0x01) - Performs level 3 routing for at least one network layer
protocol.

=back

Thanks to Martin Lorensen C<martin -at- lorensen.dk> for a pointer to this
information.

(C<cdpCacheCapabilities>)

=item $cdp->c_domain()

Returns remote VTP Management Domain as defined in
C<CISCO-VTP-MIB::managementDomainName>

(C<cdpCacheVTPMgmtDomain>)

=item $cdp->c_duplex() 

Returns the port duplex status from remote devices.

(C<cdpCacheDuplex>)

=item $cdp->c_id()

Returns remote device id string

(C<cdpCacheDeviceId>)

=item $cdp->c_if()

Returns the mapping to the SNMP Interface Table.

Note that a lot devices don't implement $cdp->c_index(),  So if it isn't
around, we fake it. 

In order to map the cdp table entry back to the interfaces() entry, we
truncate the last number off of it :

  # it exists, yay.
  my $c_index     = $device->c_index();
  return $c_index if defined $c_index;

  # if not, let's fake it
  my $c_ip       = $device->c_ip();
    
  my %c_if
  foreach my $key (keys %$c_ip){
      $iid = $key;
      ## Truncate off .1 from cdp response
      $iid =~ s/\.\d+$//;
      $c_if{$key} = $iid;
  }
 
  return \%c_if;


=item $cdp->c_index()

Returns the mapping to the SNMP2 Interface table for CDP Cache Entries. 

Most devices don't implement this, so you probably want to use $cdp->c_if()
instead.

See c_if() entry.

(C<cdpCacheIfIndex>)

=item  $cdp->c_ip()

If $cdp->c_proto() is supported, returns remote IPV4 address only.  Otherwise
it will return all addresses.

(C<cdpCacheAddress>)

=item  $cdp->c_addr()

Returns remote address

(C<cdpCacheAddress>)

=item $cdp->c_platform() 

Returns remote platform id 

(C<cdpCachePlatform>)

=item $cdp->c_port()

Returns remote port ID

(C<cdpDevicePort>)

=item  $cdp->c_proto()

Returns remote address type received.  Usually IP.

(C<cdpCacheAddressType>)

=item $cdp->c_ver() 

Returns remote hardware version

(C<cdpCacheVersion>)

=item $cdp->c_vlan()

Returns the remote interface native VLAN.

(C<cdpCacheNativeVLAN>)

=item $cdp->c_power()

Returns the amount of power consumed by remote device in milliwatts munged
for decimal placement.

(C<cdpCachePowerConsumption>)

=back

=head1 Data Munging Callback Subroutines

=over

=item $cdp->munge_power()

Inserts a decimal at the proper location.

=back

=cut
