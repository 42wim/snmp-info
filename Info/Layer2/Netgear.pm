SNMP::Info::Layer2::Netgear - SNMP Interface to Netgear switches

=head1 AUTHOR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you. 
 my $netgear = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        ) 
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class      = $netgear->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides abstraction to the configuration information obtainable from a 
Netgear device through SNMP. See inherited classes' documentation for 
inherited methods.

=head2 Inherited Classes

=over

=item SNMP::Info::Layer2

=back

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item Inherited Classes' MIBs

MIBs listed in L<SNMP::Info::Layer2/"Required MIBs"> and its inherited
classes.

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP

=head2 Overrides

=over

=item $netgear->vendor()

Returns 'netgear'

=item $netgear->os()

Returns 'netgear' 

=item $netgear->model()

Returns description()

=back

=head2 Global Methods imported from SNMP::Info::Layer2

See documentation in L<SNMP::Info::Layer2/"GLOBALS"> for details.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of
a reference to a hash.

=head2 Overrides

=over

=item $netgear->fw_mac()

Returns reference to hash of forwarding table MAC Addresses.

Some devices don't implement the C<BRIDGE-MIB> forwarding table, so we use
the C<Q-BRIDGE-MIB> forwarding table.  Fall back to the C<BRIDGE-MIB> if
C<Q-BRIDGE-MIB> doesn't return anything.

=item $netgear->fw_port()

Returns reference to hash of forwarding table entries port interface
identifier (iid)

Some devices don't implement the C<BRIDGE-MIB> forwarding table, so we use
the C<Q-BRIDGE-MIB> forwarding table.  Fall back to the C<BRIDGE-MIB> if
C<Q-BRIDGE-MIB> doesn't return anything.
